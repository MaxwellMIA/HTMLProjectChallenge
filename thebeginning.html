    <p><i>Roblox</i> was made in 2004 by David Baszucki and Erik Cassel, under the name <i>DynaBlocks</i> for testing, before 2005 when its name was changed to <i>Roblox</i> offically. <i>Roblox</i> was offically released to the public on September 1st, 2006 for the computer.</p>
    <p>On December 11, 2012, <i>Roblox</i> was givin to iOS. On July 16, 2014, an Android version was released, before getting released for Xbox one on November 20. In April 2016, <i>Roblox VR</i> came out, with <i>Roblox</i> for Windows 10 following right after in June.</p>
    <p> Around this time, <i>Roblox</i>removed there safe chat, which let users talk through pre-made messages, and replaced it with a blacklist for words that would get censored out when used. This chat does censor words and numbers pretty well even typed normally, but over the years people have found ways to bypass this chat.</p>
    <p>The last thing needed to be mechioned in this time frame is when <i>Roblox</i> took away the guest feature. Which was the feature to play the game without having an account. Guests couldn't use the chat feature, but where still highly loved by the <i>Roblox</i> community. This feature getting removed highly upset the community, and to this day people are still upset.</p>
